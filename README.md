# VQ-VAE Project

## Introduction
This project explores the implementation and experimentation of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Pixel Convolutional Neural Networks (Pixel CNN). VQ-VAE is a type of autoencoder that uses vector quantization techniques to improve the quality of latent space representations, making it particularly useful for tasks such as image generation and modification. Pixel CNN further enhances the model's ability to generate high-quality images by conditioning the generation process on previous pixel values in a structured manner.

## Key Components
- **ADJUSTING WEIGHT OF VQ LOSS**: This section delves into the impact of varying the weight of the VQ loss term in the VQ-VAE model's training process.
- **Experimenting with beta=1.5**: An experiment to observe the effects of setting the beta parameter to 1.5, which influences the balance between reconstruction loss and latent space regularization in the VAE framework.
- **Pixel CNN**: Introduction and implementation of Pixel CNN as a generative model to refine the outputs of the VQ-VAE model, offering enhanced image generation capabilities.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for modeling and training the VQ-VAE and Pixel CNN architectures.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
